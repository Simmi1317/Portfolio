          <b> Differences/Similarities Between Scratch and Python: </b> Both follow around the same style of formatting and layering, though Scratch used blocks instead of language.

          <b>How was debugging?</b> Debugging, was an experience in frustration. The feeling when you finally figured it out is only matched by the amount of anger you feel when you can't.

          <b> What I learned About Circuits: </b> You must close all portions of a circuit for it to work, and pay attention to the direction the electricity flows to ensure that all works as it should.
          <br>
          <b> What Makes You Excited About The Future of Robotics?</b> Just seeing what humans come up with next. May it be in the art of warfare or self driving cars, anything and everything about robotics to come will undoubtedly change the world forever.
          <br>
          <b>What Worked Well When Working In Groups?</b> Having everyone participate and other ideas, as well as the trial of new and different things - it was all very well done.
          If I were to change anything I think that we should introduce the idea of delegating like Group 4 did with their project.
